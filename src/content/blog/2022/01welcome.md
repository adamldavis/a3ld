Hello! Welcome to A3LD. Why A3LD? Mainly because it's a four letter domain
that was available, but it stands fro Agile Adaptive Accessible Lean Development. 
All things that I'm passionate about.

Ever since software development began, its practitioners have sought
to understand it, make it easier, and to make its results more predictable.
The nature of software development has always been questionable - is it science,
math, art, engineering, or some mixture of these?

I believe the answer is yes, all of the above and more. Computers with the
aid of software and the internet, and everything that comes with it
are changing the world and effecting every aspect of our lives. 
It touches every domain, and where it interacts with different domains
it takes on a different aspect.

I'm not sure what this site will become but for now it's a playground for anything
and everything I can think up (and even some things that you think up).
