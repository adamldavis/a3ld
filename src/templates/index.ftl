        Hi there!
        <br />
        <p>
        I've been a software developer for over fifteen years and have always had a passion for software.
        <p>
        Over the years I've gained a lot of experience in various programming languages, software development practices, systems, and design principles
        - constantly looking to improve and learn.
        <p>
